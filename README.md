Code to create music

To play the piano.  Launch airpiano.py.  A frame will open.  Use blue stick to control the tones and a red one to control the sound level.    
It will simply simulate key presses.  So, if you launch for instance https://www.onlinepianist.com/virtual-piano,  it will play the sounds.
